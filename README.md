# EASY-VISA
The U.S. job market faces a high demand for skilled workers, making talent acquisition a  key challenge for companies. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) oversees visa approvals for foreign workers under the Immigration and Nationality Act  (INA) to address workforce shortages while protecting U.S. labor standards.With a growing number of applications each year, manually processing visa certifications has become inefficient and time-consuming. A data-driven solution is needed to streamline the visa approval process, improve decision-making, and ensure compliance with labor regulations
# Solution Approach
The project will utilize ensemble techniques for classification, including
1. Bagging Classifier – Reduces variance and improves stability by training multiple 
Decision Trees.
2. Random Forest Classifier – Enhances decision-making by aggregating multiple trees.
3. AdaBoost Classifier – Improves weak learners by focusing on misclassified cases.
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier – Optimizes predictions through sequential corrections.
5. Stacking Classifier – Combines multiple models for a more accurate final prediction.
6. Decision Tree Classifier – Serves as the base model for ensemble techniques
